The increaseValue function in the provided code is responsible for incrementing the counter state value by 1. It achieves this by using the setCounter function provided by the useState hook from React.

The setCounter function is used to update the value of the counter state variable. It takes a new value as an argument and triggers a re-render of the component with the updated value. In the addValue function, setCounter is called four times in a row, each time incrementing the previous value by 1. This is achieved by using the previous value of the counter state variable as an argument to the setCounter function.

If we were to write setCounter(counter + 1) four times in a row in the addValue function, it would not work as expected. This is because the setCounter function is asynchronous, and calling it multiple times in a row with the same value would not result in multiple updates. React batches state updates for performance reasons, so calling setCounter(counter + 1) multiple times in a row would only result in a single update with the final value of counter + 1.

The decreaseValue function, on the other hand, simply subtracts 1 from the counter state variable using the setCounter function. It directly uses the current value of counter to calculate the new value to be set.

Overall, the functionality of both functions is to modify the counter state variable by either incrementing or decrementing its value. The setCounter function is used to update the state and trigger a re-render of the component with the updated value.
